      <h1>Generative AI ft. Shrek memes</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our webpage! We are a group of students from Braunschweig
        University of Art, and we are excited to present to you our project on
        Generative AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will ask us, what is special about our project? Well, we have
        combined the power of Generative AI with the magic of Shrek memes!
        During our work we cooperated with two independent AI to create the
        content, one that generates text and another that generates images,
        namely ChatGPT and AdobeFirefly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Have you ever had this wild fever dreams during being sick? We used
        ChatGPT to generate plot of a dream like this and then we asked
        AdobeFirefly to visualize it. But this is not all! We used Shrek memes
        as a reference for the image generating AI. Which means that the
        generated images are inspired by Shrek memes. We hope you will enjoy the
        results as much as we do!We were feeding AdobeFirefly with dreams
        dividing them into parts to make it easier for the AI to catch all the
        important aspects of the dream. So we got a series of images that are
        forming the whole story. At the end we added a bit of human impact to
        create a collage of the generated images.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we used Shrek memes as a reference, we decided that the final result
        should be also presented as a meme. We asked ChatGPT to help us with
        this. It created sayings we could use for our collage. We think it could
        be a great example of how person can interact with AI to create
        something new and unique!
